# PVHA_WF
Probabilistic Volcanic Hazard Assessment Workflow

What is PVHA_WF

PVHA_WF is a workflow created to develop the probabilistic volcanic hazard assessment for tephra fallout at ground and ash concentration at flight levels for a specific volcano, both short-term and long-term. This software is an update of the Bet-Tephra (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4638667) Python software package, is based on the Bayesian Event Tree methodology, uses the WMS-light (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6340199) and interacts with the ash dispersion model FALL3D (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6343786).
